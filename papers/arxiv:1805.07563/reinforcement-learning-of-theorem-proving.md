# Reinforcement learning of theorem proving

https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07563

Very nice results that should that reinforcement learning can help
guide searches in the field of symbolic reasoning.  It's important to
note that the value and policy estimates are not given by neural
networks but by boosted linear classifiers (XGBoost and LIBLINEAR) on
handwritten features.
