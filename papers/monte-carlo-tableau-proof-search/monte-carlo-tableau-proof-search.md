# Monte Carlo Tableau Proof Search

I don't find this paper particularly convincing and in fact it just
strengthens my belief that MCTS doesn't make sense for a setting that
is not a two-player zero-sum extensive form game.  The evidence for
this is the Î²-minimal Expansion Policies which are heuristics needed
to make the algorithm more efficient.  It seems these heuristics
manipulate the "game tree" in a way that does not preserve the
original structure of the proof search tree.
