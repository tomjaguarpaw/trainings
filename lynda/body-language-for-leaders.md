* Emotions are highly contagious

## Five major mistakes

1. They'll look for the negative -- people are more sensitive to perceived
negative signals
2. They won't consider the context
3. They'll find meaning in one gesture -- such as looking at a watch
4. They won't know your baseline, i.e. won't spot differences to normal
behaviour
5. They'll evaluate you through an array of biases

Get your body language to match your words otherwise your verbal message is
lost.  Body language can't hide your innermost feelings.  In fact in most
cases it reveals those feelings.

## First impressions

In sever seconds or less people will have judged your trustworthiness,
competence, warmth and confidence.

## Six powerful keys

1. Adjust your attitude -- make a conscious choice about the attitude you
want to embody.
2. Fix your posture
3. Smile
4. Make eye contact
5. Raise your eyebrows
6. Lean in

Extra tip for the rest of the conversation: repeat the person's name during
conversation and touch them lightly on the arm.  Anchor good feeling to
touching their arm.

## Ten elements to shaking hands

1. Stand up
2. Make right hand ready for action
3. Make eye contact
4. Smile
5. Square off, face counterparty fully
6. Palm facing sideways
7. Palm-to-palm contact
8. Shake hands firmly
9. Start talking before you let go
10. Keep your eyes up

## Establishing leadership presence

* Sit tall, shoulders back, legs uncrossed.
* Use confident gestures.
* Take control with palm-down hand signals
* Move hands away from torso to communicate confidence, security and trust.

## Conveying warmth and empathy

* Lean forward
* Palms open

## Conveying confidence

* Begin thinking of a time when you were genuinely enthused and confident.
(Keep a business success log to remember these!)
* Visualise: remember feelings and how you looked and sounded at the time.

## Vocal prosody

1. Breathe: belly breathe
2. Vary vocal tone
3. Vary volume and speech rate
4. Find your perfect pitch
5. Avoid upspeak

## Gestures and stance

Effective emblems in one culture may be meaningless or rude in another.
