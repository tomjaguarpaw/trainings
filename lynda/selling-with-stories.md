## What is a sales story?

A story is a narrative about something interesting that happened to someone.
It contains

* A time
* A place
* A main character
* A goal
* An obstacle
* A resolution

A sales story is any story used in the service of making a sale or retaining
a customer.

## Why tell sales stories?

1. Storytelling builds trust by providing a personal, intimate and vulnerable
   glimpse into your world.

2. Storytelling speaks to the part of the brain where decisions are made.
   (Rational and logical justification takes place after the decision has
   been made)

3. Stories make it easier for buyers to remember you, your ideas and your
   product.

4. Storytelling increases the value of the product you sell.  Narrative
   transforms insignificant objects into significant ones.

5. Stories are contagious.

6. Buys want more stories from you.

## The 25 stories you need

25 stories amongst these phases of selling

1. Introducing yourself

   A story about what you do and a story about how you helped a customer

2. Preparing for a sales call

   To relax and take the stress out of a call

3. Building rapport with a buyer

   Why you do what you do for a living; story about your company.

4. Making the sales pitch

   The story of the invention or discovery of the product they're selling;
   the problem your product or service is designed to serve; a customer
   success story; value adding story

5. Handling objections

   Story of a customer who had the same objection; why your product is worth
   the price you change; stories to resolve the most common objections
   before they're ever brought up

6. Closing the sale

   Story to create a sense of urgency; coaching the breakup story (firing
   the current supplier)

7. Managing relationships

   Tell stories about your happiest customers; loyalty building stories;
   stories for your colleagues to learn from

## Getting the buyers to tell their stories

The best stories to get a prospect to tell are

1. A personal story
2. Their biggest problem
3. A story about how their favourite supplier became their favourite
   supplier, so you can become their favourite supplier

* Shut up and listen
* Ask open-ended questions (e.g. "how did you find your biggest problem was
  your biggest problem")
* Ask about specific events in time
* Ask problem prompts (probe for problem you think your prospect might have)
* If all else fails, tell stories first

## What makes a great story a great story?

1. A hero we care about (a relatable main character)
2. A villain we're afraid of (a relevant challenge)
3. An epic battle (honest struggle between them)

For a sales story, also a worthy lesson.

Choose a main character who is relevant to your audience

## Choose the right story to tell

1. Define your objective

2. Look for relevant success, failure or moment of clarity

3. If you can't think of a story, make one up, but *only* on the condition
   that you tell your audience it is made up.

4. Pick the best story, i.e. how best your audience will respond to the
   elements of the story regarding what you are trying to communicate.

## Where to find great stories

* Maintain a list of stories you want to find.  The 25 common sales stories is
  a good place to start.

* Search your own past and present

* Keep a sales story journal

* Stalk product reviews

* From other people.  Ask around.  Share your wish list.

* Go an regular story hunts.  Around the organisation ask "got any good
  stories?"

* Follow up up with customers who've paid you a compliment or complaint.

* ... lots more

## Story structure

Context; challenge; conflict; resolution

Understand the questions that your story needs to answer and the order it
needs to answer them.  The each questions that your story needs to answer
are

1. Why should I listen to this story?
2. When and where did it take place?
3. Who's the main character and what do they want?
4. What is the problem or opportunity they ran into?
5. What did they do about it?
6. How did it turn out in the end?
7. What did you learn from it?
8. What do you think I should do now?

The order you answer those questions matters.  The resolution and action
goes at the end not the beginning.

## The hook

A single phrase or sentence that answers the question "why am I telling this
story?"/"Why should I listen to this story?"

Don't tell your audience you're going to tell them a story.  Don't give away
too many of the details away in the introduction.

## The context

* Parts 1-3 of the story structure.

* Don't be the hero/main character in your stories.

* What does the main character want?  Something worthy, or at least
  intriguing.

## Challenge, conflict, resolution

How do you know when you've wrapped up the loose ends?  When your audience
knows how to *feel* (not think) about what happened.

## Lesson and action

You can do any or all of three things

1. Listen

2. Explain the lesson

3. Recommend action

## Emotion

Emotions play a crucial role in decision making.  Human beings make
subconscious, emotional decisions in one place in the brain, and
subsequently justify those decisions more logically and rationally in
another place in the brain.

1. Tell me: Name the emotions your characters are experiencing, or better.

2. Show me: Describe the physical effect of the emotion on the characters.

3. Let your audience get to know your characters before something emotional
   happens to them.

4. Dialogue: Let your audience hear what your characters are feeling in
   their own words.

## Surprise

Surprise makes your sales stories more effective

Surprise at the start gets them to pay attention.  Surprise at the end helps
them remember what they learned.

Start with the most surprising thing that happens in your story and then
flash back.

To end with a surprise mention something important that you deliberately
omitted from the beginning.

## Details

1. Add details that explain the main character's motivations, and nothing
   else.

2. Replace general words with specific ones ("at least 6 foot 4" instead of
   "tall")

3. Show, don't tell.  Show how your character's emotions are affecting their
   behaviour.

## Delivery: oral and written

It's better to tell the wrong story with a stunning performance than tell then
right story in a mediocre fashion.  That said

* be conversational
* blend into conversation
* don't memorise

In writing, write the way you'd like to speak.

## Tell stories with data

Tell people your discovery story and allow them to reach your conclusions on
their own.
