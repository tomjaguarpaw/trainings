# Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/diversity-inclusion-and-belonging/integrate-dibs-into-the-employee-life-cycle

Summary: this is a really upbeat and short course explaning the benefits of
nurturing diversity, inclusion and belonging in an organisation.

People want to feel like they belong to a community, that they have
psychological safety and that "someone really cares about me and my unique
self".

# Hold up a mirror using the data

Movement happens when I have both your mind and your heart

* Data grabs the intellect

* Emotions grab the heart

* If you couple them together it's way more powerful

## How to improve "employee experience"

* We are genetically wired to belong to a community

* Power of taking a moment of uncertainty is through story-telling

* When you share stories you can shorten an uncertainty moment and shorten
  the distance to productivity

* Paul Nack: power of story-telling: story-telling releases chemicals in our
  brains to make us more compassionate, empathetic

* Story-telling is an underrated amazing tool that every human being should
  explore more

## It's about you

If you're a manager you have an opportunity to change lives on your team by
creating belonging moments and share your story with your team

# Hiring diverse talent

* You have to slow your brain.  If you go fast your biases creep up.

* Every individual makes the job bigger or better because of who they are. 
  Job description describes only 25% of the candidate.

* When you recruit someone tell them "why you"

* We all make mistakes. We have to have a compassionate company.

# How to listen to employees

* All hands

* Mini lunches

* Be as aproachable as possible (formal title can be a barrier)

* Poll new hires

* Poll those who said no to us

# Intergrate DIBs into the employee life cycle

* DIBs should be in the DNA of everything that we do, not an initiative

* Do you see people like you?

* Do you feel like you're celebrated because of your unique background?

# Measure with a DIBs index

* How do we measure DIBs?

* Drivers of DIBs engagement

    * Someone cares about me at work

    * When something bad happens, I feel OK, I feel safe

    * Have you given a belonging moment to someone else?

* How you emote, how your body talks to me, is really what I look for and
  listen to

# Operationalise DIBs

* Small things you can do every day to make someone feel great

    * Start meetings with gratitude -- i.e. share things you are personally
      grateful for outside of work.  This helps the team to get to know each
      other as individuals.

    * Share gratitude to another team.

    * Be aware of the voices that are not being heard.  In a remote meeting
      assign an individual in the room to look after the interests of each
      remote participant.

    * Say "thank you" and appreciate people.

    * If someone has something to say and they're striving to be heard then
      the least you can do is listen.  Don't fill in the gaps or fill it in
      for them.
