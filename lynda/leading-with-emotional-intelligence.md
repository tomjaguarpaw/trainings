## What is emotional intelligence?

You have to be able to lead yourself before you can lead others so it's
important to develop the personal competence part of emotional intelligence
first.

You may want to take the official EQ assessment developed by Dan Goleman
called the "Emotional and Social Competence Inventory" or ESCI.

## Why emotions are key

When the reptilian brain kicks off it literally shuts down the function of
the other portions of our brain (amygdala hijack).  It makes us incapable of
any kind of intelligent action, emotional or otherwise.

## Getting to know yourself

At the core of emotional intelligence is knowing yourself.  Everything else
flows from there, so it should be your first focus.

## Understanding our feelings

You need to carve out time to feel. Some people have found that meditation
is a great way to do this.

Dr Brene Brown has researched how we get more happiness and joy in our
lives, and she found that the two key components are expressing gratitude
and allowing yourself time to play.

## Working with your triggers

Triggers are the scars of old wounds.
