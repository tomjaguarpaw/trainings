# Pitching Projects and Products to Executives

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/pitching-projects-and-products-to-executives

## Preparing for a pitch

* Know your audience, understand your collaborators, listen to key
  stakeholders

* Get yourself out of the picture and go with them.  Go on their
  journey.  See it from their perspective.

## Learning what executives want

* You have to speak their language and what they care about.

* Know enough about them or find out from someone else.

## Socialising an idea

* Build consensus

* Stories build in strength by retelling

* Never make it your idea

## Dealing with naysayers

* Bring in people and understand their points of view

* Reinvestigate the objections

* For a highly controversial topic you can meet people separately
  before getting into the larger group

## Prototyping effectively

* Prototype to answer questions

* Fail quickly

* Prototypes are disposable

* Don't make them think that you feel your career depends on this
  prototype or you won't get honest feedback

## Creating the right environment

* Remove distractions

* Is it a place they feel they can be candid and open?

* In a relaxed atmosphere they will start to fill in more details on
  their broader sweeping statements

## Pitching effectively

* Anticipate questions

* The person who is most passionate should pitch

* Make the idea that you have tangible.  Make the future you want to
  create real.

## Learning from real mistakes

* If you're not failing you're probably not learning

## Closing the deal

* Moving ideas forward has more to do about being confident, humble,
  and just ask for the work

* At the end you've either convinced them or you haven't.

* Invite very bluntly criticisms about what you got wrong.

* You always have to ask for the work.  You have to ask for the green
  light.

* Do they react to the ask?  Is there some negotiation?  Do they
  change the ask?

* At the start, say "if this goes well what I want you to do is to
  give me three engineering resources and release some budget for
  designers so I can work on it for three months.  Is that OK?" and
  then do the pitch.

* If it's pretty clear you've closed, stop.

## Passion

* Be passionate about getting something made
