## How to create positive relationships with your team

1. Introduce yourself

    * On video, Skype, Facetime etc.

    * Talk about non-work topics, make it personal

    * Schedule 1-on-1 meetings

2. Set specific expectations

    * *Agree* on how to work together

3. Create new communication habits

    * Be perceived as being dependable

    * Have a set schedule to communicate, the same time every week

    * Have face-to-face meetings, teleconference if not in person

    * Make a visual about what you want to create

4. Follow up

    * Check in

    * Clarify

    * Confirm

## Scheduling

* Keep timezones in mind

* Respect your team's calendars

* Be mindful of national, regional and religious holidays

* Have a semi-formal communication plan

* Be mindful of appropriateness of communication methods

* Verify

* Make building meeting agendas a standard practice.

## Communicating across devices, continents and cultures

* Express interest in your employees' cultures

* Refer to times in their local timezone

* Find out the best time of day to communicate with team members

* What is their replying style?  Immediate, or after consideration?

## Getting to know your team

* Be curious.  Ask about favourite foods, hobbies, ...

* Allow your team to contact you spontaneously

* Reinforce the idea of "team".  The team wins or loses together.  No one
  person makes or breaks the team.

* Give recognition

* Understand the goals, personal and professional, of your employees.

## Feedback

* *In person*, i.e. not over email.  For remote employees this is video chat,
  or phone if necessary.

* Apply balance.  Don't assume they know what you think they're doing right.

* Co-evaluate.  Ask them what they think went wrong or badly.

## Deciding what success looks like

* Establish the right criteria

    * Target

    * How -- whenever possible let this come from your team members

    * Build success criteria as a team

* Assume there is always more your employees have to share.  Ask "what
  else?".

* Have a "take 2" to reestablish your criteria in a followup meeting.

* Review results

## Identifying expectations

* Establish role basics

* Ensure your team knows who's who

* Share your role with your team, especially what you can help them with.

* Ask what worked or didn't work for them in previous remote engagements.

## Establishing team norms

Response times for text messages, emails, under normal and urgent
conditions, etc.

## Using skill and personality assessments

* If you do it for one, do it for all

* The initial debrief should be done by a third party

* Assessments are not diagnostic  tools.  Don't use them to find out "what's
  wrong" with people.

## Understanding habits

Ask your employees

* Morning, afternoon or night person?

* What do you do when you need inspiration?

* When do you typically seek collaboration?

* When you get interrupted how long does it take to get back into working
  groove?

* How often do you need to take breaks?

* When you get stuck what do you do?

* When is it too early or too late to contact you?

## Understanding your tendencies

Have different management styles to apply depending on the situation.

* Pace setting

    * You set the goal and allow them to self-manage to the end result

* Authoritative style

* Affirming style

    * "People come first" approach

    * Particularly effective under pressure

* Encouraging style

    * "How about you try to do ..."

    * Discover strengths and encourage them

* Coercive/direct style

Decide base on

    * Need collaboration?

    * How much time do you have?

## Use your intuition

You probably have more than you think you do.

## Identifying your team's potential

Your remote team probably have hidden potential.  To discover it

* Ask them

* Skills assessment

* Scenarios.  Pitch them and ask how they would deal with it

* Ask about extracurricular activities

* Let go -- allocate items from your personal todo list to ambitious team
  members

## Managing some people in person and others remotely

Traps

* Letting what's in your face monopolise your attention

* Visit from employees only means major celebration or stern performance
  management discussion.

Give undivided attention during 1-on-1s.  Announce who is present and who is
remote during teleconferences.

## Dealing with team conflict

* Get a crystal clear breakdown of the conflict

    * What happened, not "who" did what

* Get to the problem solving stage

* Focus on the facts

* Avoid avoidance

* Avoid the blame game

* Avoid drama

## Increasing team engagement

* Ask "what else?"

* Do not interrupt

* Acknowledgement

* Check and confirm

## Special consideration for new managers

* Look into team's history

* Create a communication plan

* Allow your team to be the experts

* Ask what three things work best to help them perform their job.

* What three things cause the greatest issues as they try to do their job

## Managing when you can't see each other

* Convert unmanaged dynamics into managed dynamics

* When you can't see each other pretend that overcommunication doesn't
  exist.

## Holding remote meetings

* Occasionally have *everyone* dial in to a team meeting even local members

* Ask if anyone has anything that might mean they perform differently to
  normal in the meeting

## Developing a solid team-support structure

* Side projects to create partnerships

## Using rewards and recognition

* Is energy low?  If so, have a shared meal meeting.  Pay for food if you can. 
  Encourage each employee to have lunch or other food appropriate to their
  timezone.  Have no agenda.

* Send handwritten letter or gift card to employee who went above and
  beyond.

* Under-appreciation is a primary factor leading to burnout.

## Evaluating performance on the go

* Conduct mini-performance reviews during weekly 1-on-1s

* Co-create any action plans

* Measure performance against milestones and goals

* On-the-go checklist

    * What is working?

    * What should you be doing more of?

    * What should you be doing less of?

    * On a scale of 1 to 5 how would you rate

        * Creativity

        * Collaboration

        * Productivity

        * Communication
        
* What would support you creating a 5 in all of those areas?

* What would be different for you if you were performing at a 5?

* What would be different for your team if you were performing at a 5?  

## Addressing the top five remote management challenges

* Set up a conference call to set up expectations for what communication
  needs to look like

* The more conversations you have on the phone where you get used to how an
  employee speaks the better you get at accurately interpreting tone and
  meaning

* Manage conflict by phone calls rather than emails.  The latter is too
  impersonal and vague.

* Focus on the cause of conflict

* Establish trust.  People are more willing to trust someone who shows
  genuine concern for their wellbeing.

* Say "thank you"

* "A good leader takes a little more than his share of the blame and a
  little less than his share of the credit" -- Arnold H.  Glasgow

* Focus on listening to your team

## Tools for managing virtual teams efficiently

* Virtual conference rooms

* Social media.  Can shrink the distance between you and your team.  Can be
  very distracting.

* Email.  Emails can be misinterpreted even with the use of emoticons.

* Cell phone

* Tablets

* Cloud technology
