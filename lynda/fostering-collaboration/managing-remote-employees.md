## How to create positive relationships with your team

1. Introduce yourself

    * On video, Skype, Facetime etc.

    * Talk about non-work topics, make it personal

    * Schedule 1-on-1 meetings

2. Set specific expectations

    * *Agree* on how to work together

3. Create new communication habits

    * Be perceived as being dependable

    * Have a set schedul eto communicate, the same time every week

    * Have face-to-face meetings, teleconference if not in person

    * Make a visual about what you want to create

4. Follow up

    * Check in

    * Clarify

    * Confirm

## Scheduling

* Keep timezones in mind

* Respect your team's calendars

* Be mindful of national, regional and religious holidays

* Have a semi-formal communication plan

* Be mindful of appropriateness of communication methods

* Verify

* Make building meeting agendas a standard practice.

## Communicating across devices, continents and cultures

* Express interest in your employees' cultures

* Refer to times in their local timezone

* Find out the best time of day to communicate with team members

* What is their replying style?  Immediate, or after consideration?

## Getting to know your team

* Be curious.  Ask about favourite foods, hobbies, ...

* Allow your team to contact you spontaneously

* Reinforce the idea of "team".  The team wins or loses together.  No one
  person makes or breaks the team.

* Give recognition

* Understand the goals, personal and professional, of your employees.

## Feedback

* *In person*, i.e. not over email.  For remote employees this is video chat,
  or phone if necessary.

* Apply balance.  Don't assume they know what you think they're doing right.

* Coevaluate.  Ask them what they think went wrong or badly.

## Deciding what success looks like

* Establish the right criteria

    * Target

    * How -- whenever possible let this come from your team members

    * Build success criteria as a team

* Assume there is always more your employees have to share.  Ask "what
  else?".

* Have a "take 2" to reestablish your criteria in a followup meeting.

* Review results

## Identifying expectations

* Establish role basics

* Ensure your team knows who's who

* Share your role with your team, especially what you can help them with.

* Ask what worked or didn't work for them in previous remote engagements.
