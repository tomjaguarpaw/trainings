## When you are a speaker

* Use as many levels of communication as you can.  Line them all up, i.e.
  make sure your body language reinforces your words, etc..

* Clearly state your intent (do you want advice, do you want to vent, etc.)

* Avoid generalising and exaggerating

* Speak for yourself: Make "I" statements, again, no generalising

## When you're a listener

* Be an active listener

* Use non-verbal signals

* Avoid building a counter-argument in your head

* Ask questions/paraphrase

## Failed difficult conversations

Failed conversations about difficult topics follow this pattern

* Build up

* Case building (you gather evidence as to why the other person is wrong)

* Confrontation

* Aftermath

## Successful difficult conversations

Successful conversations about difficult topics follow this pattern

* Build up

* Reflection

    * Why does the other person's behaviour bother you?

    * What do you really want?

    * Attempt to see things from their point of view

* Conversation

* Follow through

To shorten the build up phase decrease your tipping point, i.e. when
something annoys you, take action sooner.

As well as verbal communication, consider "paraverbal" communication, how
the words are used, as well as non-verbal communication, e.g.  body
language.

Important elements of conflicts lie in unsaid thoughts.  Consider what you
said and did, as well as what you thought but did not say.  Consider that
the other person also has things he or she did not say that you are unaware
of.

## Ladder of inference

We "climb" a "ladder of inference", possibly incorrectly, about someone
else's motivations and intentions.

* Observable facts

* Selected data: which of the facts did you focus on?

* Assumptions: what would be in our "cartoon thought bubble" during the
  interaction?

* Conclusions: the "story" or extra level of meaning

* Emotions: how you are feeling in the interation

* Beliefs: fill in the blanks to discover your beliefs

    * "What I know about this person is ..."

    * "It's obvious to me that ..."

    * "And here we go again with ..."

* Actions: as a result of your beliefs or conclusions what have you done?

    * Feedback loop:

        * Beliefs affect selected data: confirmation bias

        * Actions affect facts

## Reflection phase

* What do you want to achieve?

    * What do I want

    * If I had that, what would it get me?

    * And repeat

    * And repeat

    * Until you feel done

    * Then write down the statement as "I want ...", a positive want

* Take stock of your goal

    * Break goal into components

    * Assess where you stand on each component

* Revisit the ladder

    * Review the facts

    * Seek other data, especially contrary data

* Question your assumptions

* Challenge your conclusions

* Look at the emotions the situation brings up

    * Beware of the amygdala hijack

    * "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" -- Dr John Gottmann

        * Fight: Criticism or contempt

        * Flight: Stonewalling or defensiveness

    * Knowing your triggers. Triggers are non-life threatening occurrences
      that set off a fight or flight response

        1. It will serve you well to know what triggers you

        2. Have a plan for managing your triggers

        3. Triggers are the landmines of our old wounds.  Our need for
           survival includes three emotional areas that are aspects of our
           core identity.

            * Am I competent?

            * Am I a good person?

            * Am I worthy of love?

    * Judgements.  Negative decisions you have made about others.  Ask
      yourself:

        * What do you feel righteous about?

        * What is something you think they should or should not be doing?

    * Our judgements are always a mirror to something we can't see about
      ourselves, *always* [she says!]

    * Regular mirror: Something you yourself do.  Our mirrors are not always
      visible to us.

    * Reverse mirror: Somthing we would never allow ourselves to do.

* Reflect on your adversary.  Reframe them to be your partner rather than
  your enemy.

## Conversation phase

1. Set the conversation up to be successful.  Consider your objective.

    * What is my intention?

    * What do I hope to achieve?

2. Create the right environment

    * Make your conversational partner comfortable

    * Use good timing

3. Plan for your own triggers and hijacks

4. Plan for their triggers and hijacks

5. Organise your talking points

6. Practice and role-play

### Organising your talking-points

* Design an environment that creates openness for both parties.

* Before getting into your talking-points, review

    1. Your overall goal

    2. The positive qualities you've identified in about your partner

    3. The intention you've set for this conversation

The 9 components of a successful conversation

1. Invitation: If there have already been challenging interactions the
   invitation needs to demonstrate a new direction.

2. Opening

    * Continue in the same vein as the invitation, letting the person know
      you're coming from a place of openness or co-creation.

    * Arrange seats for open communication.

    * Use language from the invitation to make it clear you don't have a
      hidden agenda.

    * Demonstrate your intent to connect, not confront.

3. Taking responsibility for your own role in the conflict.  This

    * establishes trust

    * sets an example

4. Sharing your goal

    * The goal you identified during the reflection phase

    * Connect your concern to the conversation

5. Sharing your experience

    * Use "and" not "but"

    * Share a small number of concrete examples.

6. Inviting their perceptions.  You can ask them to describe their ideal situation.

7. Getting on the same page

8. Co-creating a solution

9. Closing

    * Have a plan to specifically address the pattern you're trying to avoid.

    * Acknowledge the work you've done together in the meeting.

### If things go off-track

1. If the person is clearly not open to have the conversation, postpone it.

2. When you're taking responsibility, if they jump in and start blaming you,
   just breathe and listen.

3. If they don't agree with your goal, learn about their goal.

4. If you get triggered or hijacked, breathe and stay calm.

5. If they get triggered or hijacked, don't give up on stating your goal but
   wait until they're in a space to hear it.

## Delivering bad news

Not so much about conversations now.  This is more one-directional.

1. Make the intention of the meeting clear.

2. Phrase the news as a statement.

3. Be as accurate and as clear as possible.

4. Don't expect the other person to make you feel better.

5. Realise that they have their own journey.

## Follow through phase

Develop your action plan

1. Have a clear goal.

2. Detailed and specific.

3. It should state how progress will be measured.

4. Establish follow-up meetings.

5. Plan for meetings and setbacks.

## Acknowledging efforts to change

* Celebrate your successes

* Use the power of praise to acknowledge others' efforts to change.

* Ideal ratio of praise to criticism is 5 to 1

## What to do if it's not working

1. Don't despair

2. Revisit the reflection phase

3. Have another conversation

4. Bring in additional support

## Prevent the need for difficult conversations from developing

1. Build frequent opportunities for feedback

2. Intentionally seek feedback

    * How am I doing?

    * What are some things I can improve on?

    * If I could change one thing that would make a difference for you what
      would it be and why?

3. Reward honesty

4. Continually strengthen your relationships

5. Feedback includes praise

6. Learn how to give effective feedback
