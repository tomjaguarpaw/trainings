## Six principles of productive meetings

* Purpose

* Time (the shorter the better)

* Agenda

* Preparation

* Focus

* Leadership

Leaders should pay attention to attendees who are quiet -- ask them if they
have any thoughts.

## Ground rules

* No multi tasking

* Agree on the technology allowed in the meeting -- for example is
  note-taking on a mobile phone OK?

* Only one person speaks at a time

* Speak openly without fear

* Begin and end on time

Give people equal time to speak.


## The opening (for the leader)

* Arrive five minutes early

* Remove any distractions from the room

* Greet people

## Ask about previous committments

* If completed, then express thanks

* If not complete, ask "what got in the way?", "what obstacle did you
  encounter?", never ask "why not?"

* Always thank them at least some small amount regardless of their
  contribution.


## Keeping meetings productive and on topic

* Make general comments, not criticism of individuals

* Use a timer


## Agenda for 1:1 meetings

* Begin on time

* Follow up on previous action items

* Teach a development ["development" seems to mean "small lesson or teaching
  point"]

* Opportunity for them to ask you questions about what they need

* Opportunity for you to ask them questions

* Reconfirm committments

* Finish on time


## Who to have 1:1 meetings with?

Score the following in the range 0-3.  Add up the scores.  Have 1:1s with
the top few scoring individuals.

* Do you manage them, or vice versa? (0 *or* 3)

* Are they an ongoing customer, or vice versa? (0 *or* 3)

* Do they generally have questions for you, or vice versa?

* Do you delegate to them, or vice versa?

* Do you have to coordinate your schedule with them?

* Do you have to follow up with them on work done, or vice versa?
