* Have a servant's mindset

    * Success is determined by mindset

    * Number one job: solve your customer's problem

* Share your experience and knowledge

    * Only then have you earned the right to solve the customer's problem

* People buy from people they trust
* They trust people they like
* They like people they connect with

Buying brain stages

* Safety
* Connection
* Trust
* Understanding
* Opportunity
* Credibility

Start with the smallest market possible (cf. Ramit Sethi: "niche it down"!).
Create ideal customer personas or profiles so you know who you are
targeting.

Are they *ready*?  Do they have a problem they need solved?  And motivation
to solve it?

Are they *willing* to solve the problem today?

Are they *able*?  Do they have the budget and authority?

* 4 "I"s

  * Uncover the *issue* (address the most urgent issue)

* Identify the *impact* on the customer (quantify it if possible)

* *Invasiveness*: what will be the broader impact across the business?

* *Iceberg*: The giant barrier that prevented them solving the problem prior
  to meeting.  Generally

  * Knowledge
  * Time
  * Budget or money

Pricing motivators

* Price -- more effective on commodities
* Value (perceived)
* Quantity -- goes hand in glove with value
* Self-preservation -- get promotion/avoid demotion, etc.
* Social pressure

Barriers to change

* Awareness + motivation + ability = change

Thoughts of change lead to anxiety.  Explain how previous customers have
benefitted from change.  Focus on one incremental step at a time.


## Products vs solutions

People buy solutions ,not products.  Ask questions to get customers focussed
on solution first.

Great salespeople know the details of their customer's problem *and* can relate all the benefit of features of their
product plus the resulting feeling the customer gets using their product to
solve it, i.e. differentiate space from the competition.

Prepare yourself to sell your product

1. Make a list of top five problems your customers tend to have, that your
product or service can solve.

2. List top five to ten features your product possesses.

3. Next to each feature list the benefit that feature has to your customer.

4. List the b enefit that feature has compared to your competition.

Proof sources:

* Expert
* Celebrity
* User
* Wisdom of the crowd
* Wisdom of peers

Assign a "quarterback" to the account, a single point of contact throughout
delivery (is this the "account manager"?)

## Power of process

* Routines to give consistent and predictable results
* Consistent voice to customer base
* Keeps results consistent
* Helps identify areas for improvement

## Elements of effective sales process

* Planning and preparation - often the weakest link in sales process

  * Make a list of things you know about your prospect

  * Create a written call strategy
  * Practice your call

* In-call flow process

  * Create connection
  * Identify and prioritise issues
  * Create credibility
  * Solve the problem
  * Handle objections
  * Gain committment

Post sales activities

  * Gather customer feedback
  * Review with manager or coach
