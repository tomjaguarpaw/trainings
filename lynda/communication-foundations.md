# Communication Foundations -- John Ullmen

* We judge ourselves on intent.  Others judge us on impact.

* When presenting think about what you want the members of the audience to
  Think/Feel/Do.  Choose one top choice for each of these three.

* Distinguish private purpose from public objective

* Public objective is generally one of

    * Inform

    * Instruct

    * Invite

## Your message

* Make it simple

* Present a roadmap

* Keep the main thing the main thing

* Start strong, finish strong

## Making it memorable

* Grab them by the lapels

* Paint a picture

* Tell a story that sticks

* Put emotion in motion

## 12 Effective tactics

1. Rational analysis

2. Cite credible sources

3. Reference rules, policies

4. Clarify pain and gain

5. Initiate reciprocation or exchange

6. Create a sense of urgency

7. Align values, principles or mission

8. Connect to strategy or high level goals

9. Share success stories

10. Build from small to big

11. Lead by example

12. Like and be likeable

    * This one is easy to underestimate but the research on the
      persuasive force of likeability is very robust.  Just before you show
      up to a presentation, take a breath, clear your head, and say to
      yourself, I'm happy to be here and I'm happy to see you.

* Improve vocal delivery

* Improve posture.  Have a base position.  Consider:

    1. Posture

    2. Gestures

    3. Facial expressions

    4. Eye contact

## Incorporating their perspective into yours

Before meeting ask

* What would you like from us?

* What are your expectations?

* What's the best use of time when we meet?

Even long before the meeting

* How are you doing?

* How are we doing?

* How can we improve?

## Communicating across hierarchical levels

* Seniors: be a time maker not a time taker

* Peers: demonstrate that you have their back

* Juniors: motivate them

## Adjusting to organisational culture

## Being politically savvy

1. Learn what's not on the org chart

2. Build political capital

3. Secure stakeholder support

    A. Clarify what success is

    B. Create a list of key stakeholders

    C. Find out what it will take to influence stakeholders

    D. Take action on your plans

## Become a better listener

Level 4: connective listening

* When do you find it most difficult to use level four listening and why?

* With whom is it most important that you raise your level of listening?

* Who has modelled level four listening for you in your life and how can you
  follow their example?

## Listen like a partner not a critic

* Listen now -- leave judgement for later

* "I want the other person to feel like they're the most important person in
  the world, because they are"

* Show interest

* Ask:

    1. Description questions

    2. Cause questions

    3. Best case questions

    4. Possibility questions

    5. "Is there anything I can do to be helpful to you?"

## Increasing empathy and trust

* Making progress in work is the single most important thing to boost
  emotions, motivations and perceptions during a work day

## Rapport

* Maya Angelou: "People will forget what you said, people will forget what
  you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel"

* Secret of rapport: help others feel a little better

1. "What do you like most about ...?"

    * your job
    * this conference
    * ...

2. Show something from your recent enjoyment that made you "like/laugh/learn"
