# Leading and Working in Teams

2017-07-28

* Frame work as a learning challenge rather than as an execution challenge.

* If you want to make work safer, say, ask a simple question: "Was
  everything as safe as you'd like it to be?"

* Three essential questions:

    * What are you hoping to achieve?

    * What knowledge and background do you bring?

    * What obstacles do you face?

  (Then share your own answers)
